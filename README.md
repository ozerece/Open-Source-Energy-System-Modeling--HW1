## Description

### Function 1 : norm_df()

- In this function, I'm normalizing the hourly domestic hot water demand of Belgium by dividing each hourly demand by the total demand (sum of all hourly demand).
- **Input data** of this function is _func1_BE_load.csv_.
- **Unittest file** of this function is _test_norm_df.py_.
- In the unittest, I'm checking the sum of each columns equals to 1 or not. If code worked properly, sum of each column should equal to 1.

### Function 2 : interpolate()

- In this function, I'm interpolating the yearly final energy demand of Belgium.
- For years 2000,2005,2010,2015,2020,2025,2030,2035,2040,2045, 2050; we have the demand data. We need to interpolate this demand for each missing year in 5-years time interval.
- **Input data** of this function is _func2_BE_fed.csv_.
- **Unittest file** of this function is _test_interpolate.py_.
- In the unittest, I calculated the difference between years in 5-years interval (eg. 2000-2005; 2005-2010; 2040-2045; 2045-2050), and added the sum of differences to first known year.
- ** For example**, let's look at time interval 2000-2005. I have demand data for 2000 and 2005, and interpolated the demand for years 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004. To check my function, I calculated the yearly difference in this time interval (2000-2005) and added the sum of the differences in the value of 2000. If this value is equal to 2005, this means that my function is working properly.
